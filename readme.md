Program is created to simulate 2D lidar data in custom enviroment

features:
- create custom enviroment in paint by drawing black lines
- add noise to lidar data with standard deviation
- move and rotate lidar around the map with keyboard
- lidar data vizualization
  
 The main goal for this project is to test various SLAM algorithms.
